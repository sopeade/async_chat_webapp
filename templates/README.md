Features implemented
Things to note: No database was utilized for this project to ensure familiarity with authenticating users without a database.
Display Name on 1st sign in - This was implemented with a key-value username-password sign in and is stored
server side
File upload was chosen as my personal touch. The file is uploaded by a user and stored server side. Details are
broadcast to all users, and any user can download a file sent to members on the app.
